[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-backup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-backup)

The purpose of this role is to make backups of your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/default/playbook.yml`:
```
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  become: true

  vars:
    backup_cleanup: no

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap
    - robertdebock.backup

```

Role Variables
--------------

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```
---
# defaults file for backup

# The directory on the Ansible controller where to store backups.
backup_directory: backups

# The directory on the Ansible managed node where to temporarily store backups.
backup_remote_directory: /tmp

# Cleanup files created on the {{ backup_remote_directory }} when done?
backup_cleanup: yes

# What timestamp format to use when saving files.
backup_timestamp: "{{ ansible_date_time.date }}"

# What compression type to use, choose from gz, zip, bz2
backup_format: gz

# A list of objects to backup. Each item has these parameters:
# - name: A name of the object.
# - type: either "directory" or "mysql".
#   - "directory" will archive all files and directories found in the "source".
#   - "mysql" will make a mysql dump of the "source".
# - source: either
#   - a path (when type == directory) or
#   - a database name (when type == mysql )
# - format: either gz, zip of bz2
#
# For example:
# backup_objects:

#     type: directory
#     source: /home
#   - name: drupal
#     type: mysql
#     source: drupal
#     format: zip
